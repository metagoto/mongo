MongoDB README

DOCUMENTATION

  http://www.mongodb.org/

COMPONENTS

  mongod - The database process.
  mongos - Sharding controller.
  mongo  - The database shell (uses interactive javascript).

BUILDING

  For detail information about building, please see:

  http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Building

  If you want to build everything (mongod, mongo, tools, etc):

     $ scons .

  If you only want to build the database:

     $ scons

  To install

     $ scons --prefix=/opt/mongo install

  Please note that prebuilt binaries are available on mongodb.org and may be the easier way to get started.

RUNNING

  ./mongod

  runs the database.  Use 

  ./mongod --help

  to see command line options.

COMPILER VERSIONS

  Mongo has been tested with GCC 4.x and Visual Studio 2008.  Older versions
  of GCC may not be happy.

NOTES

  Mongo uses memory mapped files.  If built as a 32 bit executable, you will
  not be able to work with large (multi-gigabyte) databases.  However, 32 bit
  builds work fine with small development databases.

WINDOWS

  See also http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Building+for+Windows

    - vc++ express or visual studio
    - python 2.5 (for scons - 2.6 might be needed for some regression tests)
