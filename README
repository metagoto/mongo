  http://www.mongodb.org/

BUILDING
      
  see docs/building.md

RUNNING

  To see command line options invoke:

    $ ./mongod --help

  To run a single server database:

    $ mkdir /data/db
    $ ./mongod
    $
    $ # mongo shell connects to localhost and test database by default:
    $ ./mongo 
    > help

NOTES

  Mongo uses memory mapped files.  If built as a 32 bit executable, you will
  not be able to work with large (multi-gigabyte) databases.  However, 32 bit
  builds work fine with small development databases.
