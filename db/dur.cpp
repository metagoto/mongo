     PREPLOGBUFFER 
       we will build an output buffer ourself and then use O_DIRECT
       we could be in read lock for this
       for very large objects write directly to redo log in situ?
     WRITETOJOURNAL
       we could be unlocked (the main db lock that is...) for this, with sufficient care, but there is some complexity
         have to handle falling behind which would use too much ram (going back into a read lock would suffice to stop that).
         for now we are in read lock which is not ideal.
     WRITETODATAFILES
       apply the writes back to the non-private MMF after they are for certain in redo log
     REMAPPRIVATEVIEW
       we could in a write lock quickly flip readers back to the main view, then stay in read lock and do our real 
         remapping. with many files (e.g., 1000), remapping could be time consuming (several ms), so we don't want 
         to be too frequent.  tracking time for this step would be wise.
       there could be a slow down immediately after remapping as fresh copy-on-writes for commonly written pages will 
         be required.  so doing these remaps more incrementally in the future might make sense - but have to be careful
         not to introduce bugs.
